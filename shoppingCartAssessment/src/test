Project Journal - Shopping Cart POS

Design Decisions:
- Used HashMap<String, Integer> to store cart items and their quantities.
- Used a separate Item class to allow price association.
- CartOperations interface for abstraction and testability.

Challenges:
- Managing cart removal logic cleanly
- Ensuring proper input validation in console

Testing:
- JUnit tests written for add, remove, and checkout logic.

Improvements:
- Could add item descriptions or categories.
- Add file-based persistence for inventory.
